* Consider unpacking SEQUENCE OF / SET OF
   - we have region memory, so let's use it
   - the data will always be needed anyway
   - generic handling: opcode table entry can list <index,subparse>

* Consider regex-checking text fields with constraining syntax

* Have a dictionary API to manipulate controls; gperf may be used here too
